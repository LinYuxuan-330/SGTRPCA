# Readme for the SGTRPCA Package
**version June 28, 2024**

The package includes the MATLAB code of the SGTRPCA algorithm in the paper "Superpixel-Guided Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis for Hyperspectral Image Classification".


## 1) Get Started

For SGTRPCA, you can run the `test.m`. To run this code, you need to put the data set into the data folder, divided into raw data and notes, and put the.mat file after dividing the training set and the test set into the corresponding data set of train_indexes2.


## Dependencies
1. Entropy Rate Superpixel Segmentation
2. MATLAB toolboxes on my PC that you may need:
   - Deep Learning Toolbox
   - Image Processing Toolbox
   - Mapping Toolbox
   - Optimization Toolbox
   - Parallel Computing Toolbox
   - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
   - Symbolic Math Toolbox

## Acknowledgment
1. Thanks to the paper "SuperPCA: A Superpixelwise PCA Approach for Unsupervised Feature Extraction of Hyperspectral Imagery", we refer to some codes that are saved in the folder `common`.
2. Thanks to the paper "Simultaneous spatial and spectral low-rank representation of hyperspectral images for classification", we refer to its classification codes that are saved in the folder `classification_code`.
